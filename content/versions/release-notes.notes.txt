# Happy Coder Mobile App Release Notes

## Overview
This document contains the complete release history for the Happy Coder mobile app, which serves as a secure mobile companion for Claude Code. The app enables remote development sessions, voice-powered coding, and seamless synchronization across devices.

## Version 4 - September 12, 2025

### Major Features: Codex Integration and Daemon Mode

This release represents a fundamental shift in how developers interact with their remote development environments. The introduction of Codex support brings advanced AI-powered code completion and generation capabilities directly to mobile devices, while Daemon Mode revolutionizes session management by eliminating manual CLI startup requirements.

#### Key Capabilities Introduced:
- **Codex Support**: Full integration with OpenAI Codex for intelligent code completion, generation, and transformation capabilities. This enables developers to leverage AI assistance for complex coding tasks directly from their mobile devices.
- **Daemon Mode**: Now the default operation mode, the daemon runs continuously on your development machine, listening for incoming connections. This eliminates the need to manually start the CLI before each session.
- **Instant Session Launch**: Single-tap session initiation from mobile devices, with automatic connection to your development machine without any manual intervention.
- **Account Integration**: Added ability to connect both Anthropic and OpenAI accounts directly to your Happy account for seamless API key management.

## Version 3 - August 29, 2025

### GitHub Integration and Identity Management

This update focuses on bringing developer identity into the Happy ecosystem while maintaining the platform's commitment to privacy and security. The GitHub integration represents a significant step toward creating a unified developer experience.

#### Features Added:
- **GitHub OAuth Authentication**: Secure account connection using industry-standard OAuth flow, ensuring your credentials never pass through Happy's servers in plain text.
- **Profile Synchronization**: Automatic import of GitHub avatar, display name, and bio information to personalize your Happy experience.
- **Enhanced Security**: All GitHub tokens are encrypted before storage on Happy's backend, providing an additional layer of protection beyond standard database security.
- **Improved Settings UI**: Redesigned settings interface that displays your connected GitHub profile with clear visual indicators.
- **Quick Disconnect**: One-tap disconnection with confirmation dialog to prevent accidental unlinking.
- **Connection Status Indicators**: Clear visual feedback showing whether accounts are connected, disconnected, or experiencing issues.

## Version 2 - June 26, 2025

### Enhanced Connectivity and Visual Polish

#### Improvements Delivered:
- **QR Code Authentication**: Implemented secure device pairing through QR codes, allowing instant connection between mobile devices and desktop installations without manual token entry.
- **Dark Theme Support**: Complete dark mode implementation with automatic detection of system preferences, reducing eye strain during late-night coding sessions.
- **Voice Assistant Optimization**: Significant performance improvements resulting in 40% faster response times and reduced latency in voice-to-code translation.
- **File Status Indicators**: Visual badges on session list items showing which sessions have modified files, helping developers track work in progress.
- **Multilingual Support**: Voice assistant now supports 15+ languages with user-selectable preferred language, expanding accessibility for global developers.

## Version 1 - May 12, 2025

### Initial Release: Foundation for Secure Mobile Development

The inaugural release establishes Happy as a privacy-focused mobile companion for Claude Code, emphasizing security and seamless cross-device synchronization.

#### Core Features Established:
- **End-to-End Encryption**: All session data is encrypted on-device before transmission, ensuring complete privacy even from Happy's servers.
- **Voice Assistant**: Natural conversation interface for code discussions, refactoring requests, and development planning while away from the keyboard.
- **File Manager**: Experimental file browser with syntax highlighting for 50+ languages and tree-based navigation for exploring project structures.
