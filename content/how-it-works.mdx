# How It Works

Happy Coder lets you watch and control Claude Code from your phone. It uses
strong end to end encryption to keep your code private. This page explains how the system
works.

## The Three Parts

Happy Coder has three main parts that work together:

**1. CLI Program (`happy`)** - This runs on your computer. It starts Claude Code
and watches what it does. Then it encrypts this information and sends it to a
server.

**2. Mobile App** - This runs on your phone. It gets the encrypted data from the
server and shows you what Claude Code is doing. All the display code lives
here.

**3. Relay Server** - This connects your computer and phone. It passes encrypted
messages between them. The server can't read your data - it just moves
encrypted blobs around.

## Why You Need the Relay Server

The server solves a simple problem: firewalls. Your phone and computer are
usually on different networks. They can't talk directly to each other.

The server acts like a post office. Both your phone and computer connect out to
the server. This works because firewalls usually allow outgoing connections. The
server stores messages until both devices are ready.

Without the server, you'd need to set up port forwarding and deal with changing
IP addresses. That's hard and often doesn't work on mobile networks.

## Trust and Security

You might wonder: "The developers run the server. Why should I trust them?"

Good question! You don't have to trust us. Here's why:

### Your Data Stays Private

Your phone and computer share a secret key through a QR code. The server never
sees this key. Before sending any data, your computer encrypts it with this key.
The server only sees encrypted blobs - it can't read them.

> **Diagram needed**: Show the encryption flow. QR code containing secret key
scanned by CLI, both devices now have shared secret, all messages encrypted with
this secret before sending to server.

### How Your Devices Connect

Your phone and computer use their shared secret key to find each other:

**Zero Round-Trip Authentication**: Each device sends everything at once:
1. The device picks a random challenge (not the server!)
2. The device signs this challenge with its secret key
3. The device sends: challenge + signature + public key

The server checks the signature matches the public key. If it does, you're
connected. This happens instantly - no back-and-forth needed.

**Extra Security**: 
- The server only saves a hash of your public key
- The actual public key is deleted from memory right after you connect
- If someone looks at the server's hard drive, they can't even see what public keys were used

This design stops many attacks. The server can't trick you into revealing your
secret key. Even if someone hacks the server, they can't read your data.

> **Diagram needed**: Show the authentication flow with challenge-response
mechanism. Include the public key hash as channel ID, and the cryptographic
proof process.

### Run Your Own Server

The server is small - only 900 lines of code. You can:
- Read all the code in a few minutes
- Check that it really just forwards messages
- Run your own server (takes 2 minutes to set up)
- Write your own server from our spec

Both the phone app and CLI have settings to use your own server. It's easy to switch.

## How Data Moves

When you run `happy` on your computer:

1. The CLI starts Claude Code
2. Claude Code starts working on your project
3. The CLI watches what Claude Code does
4. It encrypts this information with your secret key
5. It sends the encrypted blob to the server
6. The server saves the blob and sends it to your phone
7. Your phone decrypts it and shows you what's happening

The server never knows what you're working on. It just sees encrypted data with timestamps.

## Why Save Encrypted Blobs?

The server saves encrypted blobs for two good reasons:

**See Your History**: When you close Claude Code, the CLI program stops. But you
can still open your phone app next week and see what you built. You can copy
old ideas into new projects. This is really helpful for keeping track of your
work.

**Handle Bad Connections**: This is the big one. Say you're on a train or
hiking. Your phone loses signal all the time. But your computer at home stays
connected to the server. It keeps sending updates about what Claude Code is
doing.

When your phone gets signal again, it catches up on everything it missed. You
don't lose any messages. You can check Claude Code's progress whenever you have
signal.

> **Diagram needed**: Show the resilient connection scenario - CLI with stable
connection continuously uploading, phone with intermittent connection catching
up on missed messages when it reconnects, database storing all encrypted blobs
in between.

## For Contributors

Every part of Happy Coder is open source: the CLI, the app, and the relay
server. We use a relay server to connect your devices across different networks.
The server can't read your data because everything is encrypted with keys that
never leave your devices. 

**Important**: Keep the server dumb. Don't add server
features. Put your logic in the mobile app where it belongs. If you need more
capabilities from the CLI, keep it simple there too. Use the generic API to run
a command and report the output back to the mobile app. Do not build lots of
logic into the CLI.  Let the mobile app do the real work.

## Summary

This design keeps your code private no matter what happens to the server. Even
if someone hacks it, they just get encrypted blobs they can't read. The server
knows nothing and can tell nothing. That's the whole point.
